# leap-year
With the help of this program you can check whether a year is a Leap year or not.

Every year that is evenly divisible by 4 is a Leap year
**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

For example:

    2016 is a leap year because 2016 is completely divisible by 4.
    1939 is not a leap year, because it is not divisible by 4.
    1900 is not a leap year, despite the fact that it is divisible by 4, because 1900 is divisible by 100 but 1900 is not divisible by 400.
    2000 is a leap year, because 2000 is divisible by 4 and also by both 100 and 400.

Enter the year which you want to check. If the year is a 'Leap year.' the it is printed on the console otherwise it prints 'Not a Leap year.'
